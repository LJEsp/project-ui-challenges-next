# UI Challenges
I've subscribed to the daily UI challenges from http://www.dailyui.co/ to improve my UI skills.

*Note that the focus of these challenges is the UI. Although I sometimes add functionality, some of the results' functionality may be either missing, incomplete, or buggy. Also, not designs aren't fully responsive. Fake brands a designed for some challenges.*

### Day 1: Sign Up — "Sentiment"

*I had this concept for a social app which I put most of my effort on. The sign up section was more of an afterthought. I've created reusable components for this challenge.*

### Day 2: Credit Card Checkout — "Orbital Skies"

*This challenge was difficult for me since there's a lot of ways of implemeting this UI and I'm clueless what the best practices are. I did some research but the outcome is still pretty barebones.*

### Day 3: Landing Page — "Blind Box"
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36854142/51082451-18a11100-1742-11e9-80e7-84be43c80434.png" alt="Blind Box" width="500"/>

*I watched the film Bird Box and I had this funny idea of a fashion store set in that universe. The outcome is stylish and I enjoyed animating it (not all of it, some parts were painful).*

### Day 4: Calculator — "Calculatey"
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36854142/51082465-5dc54300-1742-11e9-835f-72dcaa43be49.png" alt="Calculatey" width="500"/>

*I wanted to create something cute for this challenge and I also coded the calculator's functionality. Near the end I had the idea for the clear/reset numbers animation which I really liked (it is also where I realized the power of react-spring). This was the challenge where I first discovered and implemented the react-textfit package which allows me to make text fit their container as it scale which is very useful. This is the first UI I developed with the mobile-first approach. It made development a bit less painful and I do believe it is the better approach.*

### Day 5: App Icon — "Trevert"
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36854142/51082478-84837980-1742-11e9-92ff-6948397d5b66.png" alt="Trevert" width="500"/>

*I wasn't too excited in doing this challenge since I'm not great at making icons specially with the short amount of time. Still, I ended up with a design I'm satisfied with. The concept came from the word "revert" (hence the arrows pointing backwards). I added the T so that it becomes a palindrome. Perhaps it's an app for time travel.*

### Day 6: User Profile — "Elecy"
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36854142/51082500-f52a9600-1742-11e9-9f3b-8899326d4937.png" alt="Elecy" width="500"/>

*In this challenge I was inspired to make a super simple user profile interface. A lot of time was put into making the layout responsive in both mobile orientations. It's the first project I used grids in Figma for design which I believe helped in making a very solid layout (I used rows and columns in previous challenges).*

### Day 7: Settings *(Desktop Only)*
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36854142/51082490-bac0f900-1742-11e9-8680-258ab5e0441d.png" alt="Settings" width="500"/>

*For this challenge I wanted to make a modern UI for desktop that's friendly and easy on the eyes. The enter animation was enjoyable to make. The contents of this page came from GitHub's account settings.*

### Day 8: 404 — "Payapa"
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36854142/51082507-0bd0ed00-1743-11e9-96db-a81d7c8caa4b.png" alt="Payapa" width="500"/>

*This one is very simple. The main focus in this layout is creating the design elements in pure HTML and CSS. It's my first time coding a design like this. The combination of designing with grids and coding with space and size variables really helped a lot.*

### Day 9: Music Player — "Granite" *(Desktop Only)*
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36854142/51082568-7c2c3e00-1744-11e9-8a62-19f6e812e843.png" alt="Granite" width="500"/>

*This is one of the bigger UIs I've made. The challenge was to make a music player but I designed more of a Spotify-like site. Designing and coding each took a day.*

### Day 10: Social Share
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36854142/51523996-f6a53e00-1e67-11e9-8352-a3d7b427a818.png" alt="Social Share" width="500"/>

*A simpe social share button. I wasn't able to create the animation I originally intended which requires a more advanced use of React-Spring.*

### Day 11: Flash Message
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36854142/51126021-023ba800-185d-11e9-9cfd-84052f111c8d.png" alt="Flash Message" width="500"/>

*Creating this was delightful all throughout. Absolute positioning was heavily used to layout the design elements. This one is fully responsive!*

### Day 12: E-Commerce Shop (Single Item) — "Ample" *(Desktop Only)*
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36854142/51426366-907ca900-1c24-11e9-854e-b8aba395c440.png" alt="E-commerce shop" width="500"/>

[Figma Project Link](https://www.figma.com/file/DrBjhsmBo1o3gyh3bvQSpAFS/012_e-commerce-shop_ample?node-id=7%3A0)

*It took me a couple of days to design this interface with reponsive layouts for different screen size. I only coded the desktop layout of the interface since I realized that it would require more commitment i.e. it need to be a separate project. I would love to develop the entirety of this UI in the future.*

### Day 13: Direct Messaging — "Dusk" *(Mobile)*
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36854142/51523665-2869d500-1e67-11e9-8b46-191dd3bcbf05.png" alt="Direct Messaging" width="500"/>

[Figma Project Link](https://www.figma.com/file/RGN0Jlmiv7hCY4SugkENdXf8/013_direct-messaging_dusk?node-id=9%3A13)

*This is a typical looking UI designed with accessibility in mind. It's influenced by interfaces of by Messenger and Discord.*

### Day 14: Countdown Timer — "Game of Thrones Season 8 Countdown"
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36854142/51608503-9f2fcc80-1f52-11e9-9f2c-318dd4bde637.png" alt="Countdown Timer" width="500"/>

[Figma Project Link](https://www.figma.com/file/WkemkxXkaqgakpODpZBj0oGP/014_countdown-timer_got-countdown)

*Just a countdown timer. No functionality included.*

### Day 15: On/Off Switch
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36854142/51608627-fd5caf80-1f52-11e9-9152-d013cd73c6ba.png" alt="Countdown Timer" width="500"/>

[Figma Project Link](https://www.figma.com/file/BmrO05ADPlZRnoEkmOPrhzat/015_on-off-switch?node-id=0%3A1)

*Minimalist on/off switch. I used react-spring for animation once again.*
